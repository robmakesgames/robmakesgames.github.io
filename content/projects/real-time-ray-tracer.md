Recent advancements in the field of ray tracing have made ’real-time’ ray tracing much more viable on consumer hardware. The focus of this project was the design and implementation of a ray tracing rendering system that is capable of producing high quality, graphical
scenes in real-time. This project will take advantage of the parallel capabilities of CUDA capable cards to produce scenes that incorporate lighting effects such as shadows, reflections and refractions, whilst allowing the user to interact with it in real time.
